    Java Lambda Expressions :

    1. Lambda Expressions were added in Java 8.

    2. A lambda expression is a short block of code which takes in parameters and returns a value.
    3. Lambda expressions are similar to methods, but they do not need a name and they can be implemented right in the body of a method.

    Syntax :
    1. parameter -> expression                    // single parameter and expression
    2. (parameter1, parameter2) -> expression     // more than one praremter wrap into paranthesis
                                                  // expression : any operation e.g. (a + b)
    3. (parameter1, parameter2) -> { code block }

    Functional programming : Functional Interface reference used to store lambda expression
                             when any anonymous function treat as variable.
